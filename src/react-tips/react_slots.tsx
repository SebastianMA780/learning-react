/* 
	Sometimes it will be useful to have a component container 
	that organizes a set of other components,this can be done by 
	slots (pass a component through props).

/* 
	****Important**** :

	the slot component should always be defined outside of the component
	that use SpecialContainer, otherwise it will re-create this component on every Page re-render, 
	and that is really bad for performance and prone to bugs. 
	If youâ€™re not familiar with how quickly it can turn ugly, 
	this is the article for you:
